[Competitive programming with AlphaCode | DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/article/Competitive-programming-with-AlphaCode)

DeepMind has developed an AI capable of solving competitive programming problems. When tried out on recent CodeForces contests AlphaCode achieved a rank within the top 54% of participants. Can this be the insight of the future that Human coder will no longer need to implement every single class by their own hand and instead that AlphaCode do that?

## Thoughts
#### Helen Dong

I feel like we've always known that someday, AIs would be developed that are capable of competing with top programmers and that someday, the job of a programmer will probably become obselete as machines become more and more advanced. However, I was definitely still surprised to see how well the DeepMind AI was able to do in this coding competition (better than the average human coder!). I'm excited to see what happens next and how companies will continue to develop these types of AIs.
